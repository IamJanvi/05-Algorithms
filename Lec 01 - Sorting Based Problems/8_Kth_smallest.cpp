/*  PROBLEM: Given an array arr of size N, and a number K, less
    than N, find the Kth smallest element in the given array.

    For example: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15} and K = 3
    Output: 7 (because 3rd smallest element is 7 after 3 and 4).

    SOLUTION:
    A simple solution is to sort the given array using a O(N log N) 
    sorting algorithm like Merge Sort, Heap Sort, etc and return 
    the element at index k-1 in the sorted array.
    Time Complexity of this solution is O(N*Log N).

    A better solution with O(N) time complexity is possible, using
    modified Partition scheme of QuickSort method. Here is the logic:

    - We pick the pivot element and move the pivot element to its
      correct position and partition the array around this element.
      The idea is not to do complete Quicksort. We will not call 
      Quicksort method on the left and right partitions recursively
      on both the sides. We will just call it on one side depending 
      upon the index where pivot settled i.e. where partition occured
      and the value of K. We will just stop at the point when pivot 
      element itself settles at (K-1)th index.
    
    - The worst case time complexity of this is O(n^2), but works 
      in O(n) on average. But to reduce the chances of O(n^2) by
      a huge amount, instead of taking pivot element as first or
      last element (as we did in Sorting of 2-Data-Structures),
      here we will take random element of array as pivot. 

      So after this we can expect O(n) time complexity.

/* ADDITIONAL POINT:

    Finding 'mean' of array is an O(N) task. We need to sum entire array,
    and then divide the sum by the number of elements.

    However finding median is usually an O(N*logN) task, because median
    is the middle element of the sorted array. However, if I know the size
    of array (which usually we have), we can set - 
    
    k = N/2;    if N is odd
    or
    k1 = (N-1)/2 and k2 = N/2;  if N is even.

    For odd case, median = k'th smallest;
    For even case, median = (k1'th + k2'th smallest)/2.0;

    Thus, finding median becomes O(N) task as well after using the above code.
